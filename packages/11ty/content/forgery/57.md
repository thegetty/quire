## Provenance

–1982, Vasek Polak, 1914–97 (Hermosa Beach, CA), donated to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 1982.

## Published

A. M. Shedrinsky, D. A. Grimaldi, J. J. Boon, and N. S. Baer, "Application of Pyrolysis Gas Chromatography and Pyrolysis Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry to the Unmasking of Amber Forgeries," *Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis* 25 (1993): 77–95.

## Discussion

After a preliminary assessment that this amber sculpture was a genuine pre-Roman work, further study of the sculpture and a chemical analysis of the amber showed it to be a modern object.[^1] Stylistic similarities with the work of the forger who made the so-called Apollo of Fiumicino and an amber kouros, both once in the Grüneisen Collection, suggest that it is a work by the same hand.[^2]

[^1]: For the chemical analysis, see A. M. Shedrinsky et al. (above, this cat. entry).

[^2]: W. de Grüneisen, *Art Classique: Sculpture grecque, romaine, étrusque*, exh. cat. (Paris, 1925), pp. 1–3, pl. 1; and W. de Grüneisen, *Tableaux et esquisses de l'histoire de l'art: Apollon d'ambre trouvé à Fiumicino* (Paris, 1924). C. Albizzatti, "Analecta Gruenesiana," *Historia* [Milan], n.s., 1 (1927): 39–41, fig. 9, published the "Apollon" as a fake. I owe these references to R. D. De Puma (pers. comm., 1999).
