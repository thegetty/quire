# Quire Contributor Guidelines

*Thank you for your interest in contributing to Quire! No matter what level of experience you have, we welcome all contributions, big and small.* 

Developed by Getty, Quire is a digital publishing tool that can create dynamic publications in a variety of formats, including web, print, and e-book. Quire is an ideal tool for publishing beautiful, scholarly digital books optimized for visual imagery and designed to ensure publication content is widely accessible and stable.

Quire is open source and free to use. View Quire's [3-clause BSD open source license](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/blob/main/LICENSE). Please note: Quire v1 is currently in a pre-release phase. Testing and improvements are ongoing.

There are [many ways to contribute](#identify-a-contribution-to-make) including fixing bugs, improving the documentation, and creating a new feature or theme. Please read the following guidelines carefully. Our goal is to make the process as effective and transparent as possible, and to ensure that your contributions can become part of Quire. Thank you for taking the time.

üó£**CALLING ALL FIRST-TIMERS!** ‚Äî We can‚Äôt stress enough that Quire is open to contributors at all levels. That could mean making a modest fix, like correcting a typo or fixing a broken link, or more intensive contributions like adding Quire CSS styles and JavaScript, or even copyediting one of our documentation pages. Here are a few resources especially for you:

- Find [‚Äúgood first issues‚Äù](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/issues) tagged in our issue tracker for the main thegetty/quire repo
- Find [‚Äúgood first issues‚Äù](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/issues) tagged in our issue tracker for the thegetty/quire-docs repo
- Read the Quire guide to Making Your First Contribution ‚Äî *in progress*

**All are welcome.** As an open-source community, Quire is committed to providing a safe, welcoming, transparent, and inclusive environment for all our community members and those wishing to become involved. Please see our **[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)** for more on the expectations and protections for our community members.

## Quire Code Repositories

There are two main code repositories for Quire hosted on GitHub.

- [**quire**](https://github.com/thegetty/quire): Quire‚Äôs primary repository, with the command-line interface and 11ty template packages
- [**quire-starter-default**](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-starter-default): The default starter content for a Quire project 
- [**quire-docs**](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs): The Quire website and documentation.

## Identify a Contribution to Make

**The first step to any contribution** is to post a new issue or comment on an existing issue [on our issue tracker](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/issues/). Be sure to briefly describe your proposed solution and say whether you may need help with any aspect of it. This approach has several advantages:

- Lets people know you‚Äôre working on it
- Gives the core team and the community a chance to give feedback before you do any work
- Helps to ensure your contribution will be accepted and successfully merged in

**The second step to any contribution**, once you‚Äôve identified what you‚Äôd like to contribute, is to start work on it and eventually prepare to submit it. Read our [submission guide](#submit-your-contribution) below.

### Fix a Bug

Whether you‚Äôve found a new bug and a way to fix it, or would like to help us to tackle bugs that have already been identified, thank you!

[Post a new bug](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/issues/new)<br />
[Find an existing bug to work on](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)

When submitting a new bug please be sure to include the following information:

- Description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Version numbers
- Text file of Terminal/Shell output

### Develop a New Feature or Theme

If you‚Äôre interested in adding a new feature to Quire, keep in mind some of the questions the core team and community will be asking:

- Does this feature add something new that would be useful to a broad section of Quire‚Äôs user base?
- Does this feature positively effect Quire‚Äôs primary tenants of producing publications optimized for discoverability, longevity, beauty and accessibility?
- Does this feature integrate seamlessly in Quire‚Äôs current architecture and will it be reasonable to maintain?

Even if you plan on developing a custom feature independently and offering it to the Quire community as an add on, we highly recommend posting about it on the Quire issue tracker. This lets people know what you‚Äôre working on, gives them a chance to offer help, and can bring you valuable feedback and exposure for your work.

[Check out what's currently in development](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/issues)
[Read the Quire Technical Style Guide] - *in progress*
[Post your feature idea](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/issues/new)

Quire is very extensible. We‚Äôre eager to see more development work come from you as you create and customize your own publications in ways that can then be shared back. Quire is in the early stages of defining how this kind of contribution will work, please don‚Äôt hesitate to [email us](mailto:quire@getty.edu) with your questions or ideas.

### Write an Article

We‚Äôre always interested in adding articles about specific aspects of working in Quire to our Learn knowledge base. Maybe you have some tips on modifying shortcodes or styling is CSS in the custom.css. Chances are the community would love to read about it.

[Share your article idea](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/issues/new)

*And if you need help getting your article converted from it‚Äôs current format into Markdown and onto the Quire website, we‚Äôre happy to guide you through that process.*

### Improve the Documentation

The Quire documentation is hosted in a separate repository along with the website, and can be found [here](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs). The Quire documentation is continuously being updated for clarity and completeness, but it‚Äôs not always easy to keep up with the pace of Quire‚Äôs development!

If there‚Äôs a section you think it missing or could be improved, we‚Äôd love for your help. And the documentation is itself a Quire site, so it should be familiar to work in.

### Translate the Documentation

The Quire community is global and we hope to be able to continue to expand access to Quire, including to non-English speakers. Though we haven‚Äôt yet done any translation work on any of the documentation or materials, if that‚Äôs something you‚Äôre interested in doing, we‚Äôd love to talk to you.

[Volunteer to do some translation](https://github.com/thegetty/quire-docs/issues)

## Submit Your Contribution

*We manage Quire through GitHub. If you are new to GitHub, we recommend starting with [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github) to learn by topic, and for a broad overview, [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/). We also encourage you to check out Coding Train‚Äôs fantastic video series [Git and Github for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV). GitHub can be accessed through the command line or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).*

Once you‚Äôve identified your contribution on our GitHub [issues board](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/issues), you‚Äôll next work on it and prepare to submit it to us for review as a pull request. A pull request says, ‚ÄúHey, I did something useful for you, want to pull it in and merge it into your project?‚Äù

A pull request is a chance for Quire‚Äôs core team to evaluate the proposed changes made and decide whether to:

- merge them in as is
- merge them in with changes
- reject them

To avoid changes being rejected, we recommend you post about proposed changes on our issues board before you start work (which gives the core team and the community the chance to give feedback and raise any concerns ahead of time), and also to submit the pull request while work is still in progress.

A pull request doesn‚Äôt have to represent finished work. We always recommend opening a pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a ‚ÄúWIP‚Äù (Work in Progress) in the subject line. As you make new commits to that branch and push them to GitHub, they‚Äôll automatically be added to the open pull request.

This is something like what the development process may look like for you:

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
  - Learn more about forks and clones in GitHub‚Äôs docs on [‚ÄúContributing and collaborating using GitHub Desktop‚Äù](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop),
2. Create a branch and make your changes.
  - Contribute in the style of the project to the best of your abilities. We‚Äôre going to be writing Quire‚Äôs Style Guides to help with this, but in the meantime, please try to follow the patterns you see in the existing pages, for instance in naming classes, structuring page templates, and commenting your code for technical contributions, or in heading structure, tone, and tense for documentation contributions.
  - Test your changes by running `npm install` followed by `quire preview`. Depending on the changes you‚Äôve made you may also need to run `quire build`, `quire pdf`, and `quire epub` to make sure your changes worked. You may need to check various mobile views as well, which you can do using responsive design mode in your browser. In general, your goal with testing is to make sure your changes don‚Äôt break Quire‚Äôs existing styles or functionality. Of course, the project‚Äôs core team will be doing this too and can help guide you if something‚Äôs not working as expected.
3. Submit a pull request through GitHub.
  - If this is your first time putting in a pull request on a project like this, we recommend the [*First Contributions* command line](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions), or [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/gui-tool-tutorials/github-desktop-tutorial.md) tutorial. Or, Kent C. Dodds' video series, [‚ÄúHow to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub‚Äù](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
  - Reference any relevant issues or supporting documentation in your pull request description (for example, ‚ÄúCloses #203.‚Äù)
  - Explain what the changes do, and what your approach was. If there were alternate ways of doing it, mention them and tell us why you didn‚Äôt choose them.
  - If this is a Work in Progress pull request, comment on where you are and what your next steps are.
  - Include screenshots of the before and after if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request as needed.
4. Respond as needed to the review of your work by Quire‚Äôs core team.
  - Answer questions in the pull request comments.
  - Make changes and new commits if needed, or suggest alternate solutions if you have them.
5. See your work merged in to Quire! üéâ

**At this point, we hope you feel ready to contribute! But don‚Äôt hesitate to [ask for help or clarification](mailto:quire@getty.edu), everyone‚Äôs a beginner at first. And thank you again for your interest in making Quire a better tool for all!** ü¶Ñ
