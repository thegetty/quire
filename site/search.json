[{"content":"In the 1930s, during America\u0026rsquo;s worst financial crises, the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt employed photographers to document the plight of everyday folk in the Great Depression in order to push forward with their New Deal programs. Documentary photographers Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans were prolific frontrunners of these efforts and their extraordinary photographs continue to endure today. Their artistic and documentary mastery and historical importance provide key insight into a monumental turning point in American history.\n","id":0,"length":78,"title":"Cover","type":"cover","url":"https://gettypubs.github.io/quire-starter/"},{"content":"Dorothea Lange had an extraordinary life and career as a prolific photographer. She worked for Arnold Genthe in his portrait studio in New York and studied photography with Clarence White at Columbia University. In 1918 she began to travel around the world to make her living as a photographer. She found herself stranded in San Francisco, so she opened a photographic studio there. Paul Taylor, who would become her second husband, hired her to document migratory workers in California.\n Dorothea Lange, Resettlement Administration photographer, in California, 1936.   fullscreen   Dorothea Lange, Resettlement Administration photographer, in California, 1936. Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division     In 1935 she began to work for the Resettlement Administration, later known as the Farm Security Administration (fig. 1). During this period, she made her most famous image, Human Erosion in California (Migrant Mother), of Native American Florence Owens Thompson and her children in a pea-pickers\u0026rsquo; camp. Other less famous subjects included Japanese internment camps and scenes of workers in factories during World War II. Lange became the first woman awarded a Guggenheim fellowship, and she spent nearly ten years making photo essays for Life and other magazines. She also traveled extensively, making photo essays in Vietnam, Ireland, Pakistan, India, and elsewhere.\n  Walker Evans, profile, hand up to face, 1937.   fullscreen   Walker Evans, profile, hand up to face, 1937. Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division     Walker Evans began to photograph in the late 1920s, making snapshots during a European trip. Upon his return to New York, he published his first images in 1930. During the Great Depression, Evans began to photograph for the Resettlement Administration, later known as the Farm Security Administration (FSA), documenting workers and architecture in the Southeastern states (fig. 2). In 1936 he traveled with the writer James Agee to illustrate an article on tenant farm families for Fortune magazine; the book Let Us Now Praise Famous Men came out of this collaboration.\nThroughout his career Evans contributed photographs to numerous publications, including three devoted solely to his work. In 1965 he left Fortune, where he had been a staff photographer for twenty years, to become a professor of photography and graphic design at Yale University. He remained in the position until 1974, a year before his death.\n      Echoing the work of Lange and Evans, contemporary photographer Chris Killip documents social landscapes and is known for a series of powerful images of struggling industrial communities in North East England.

While considering a position with the RA in the spring of 1935, he jotted down those things he would require of his employer, including the \u0026ldquo;guarantee of one-man performance,\u0026rdquo; and what he would provide, adding that he should not be asked to do anything more in the way of political propaganda: \u0026ldquo;[I] Mean never [to] make photographic statements for the government or do photographic chores for gov or anyone in gov, no matter how powerful—this is pure record not propaganda. The value and, if you like, even the propaganda value for the government lies in the record itself which in the long run will prove an intelligent and farsighted thing to have done. NO POLITICS whatever.\u0026rdquo; (Citation: Evans 1938Evans, Walker. American Photographs. New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1938.)\n     A selection of Walker Evans photos from the across the United States of America, 1930s. The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles     Because his pictures had been issued by the agency with policy-approved captions for the past three years, Evans felt the need in 1938 to distance himself from that establishment, as well as the world of commercial publishing, by prefacing American Photographs with this statement: \u0026ldquo;The responsibility for the selection of the pictures used in this book has rested with the author, and the choice has been determined by his opinion: therefore they are presented without sponsorship or connection with the policies, aesthetic or political, of any of the institutions, publications or government agencies for which some of the work has been done.\u0026rdquo;2 Stryker\u0026rsquo;s business was to provide informative images to the mass media, and he and Evans would always disagree about the most appropriate vehicle for the latter\u0026rsquo;s photographs, as well as the definition of \u0026ldquo;documentary.\u0026rdquo; But when the photography project of the RA began, the two men were able to agree on its primary subject: American history as exemplified by life in the average American town. Evans\u0026rsquo;s vision for documenting American life had begun to form much earlier; a letter drafted to his friend Ernestine Evans, an editor at J. B. Lippincott, in February of 1934, makes clear his aspirations:\n What do I want to do? \u0026hellip; I know now is the time for picture books. An American city is the best, Pittsburgh better than Washington. I know more about such a place. I would want to visit several besides Pittsburgh before deciding. Something perhaps smaller. Toledo, Ohio, maybe. Then I’m not sure a book of photos should be identified locally. American city is what I\u0026rsquo;m after\u0026hellip;. People, all classes, surrounded by bunches of the new down-and-out. Automobiles and the automobile landscape. Architecture, American urban taste, commerce, small scale, large scale, the city street atmosphere, the street smell, the hateful stuff, women\u0026rsquo;s clubs, fake culture, bad education, religion in decay\u0026hellip;.3\n The two men could find common ground in part due to the widespread influence of the 1929 publication Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture by Robert and Helen Lynd, professors of sociology at Columbia and Sarah Lawrence, respectively. A 550-page field investigation by social anthropologists with subject headings including \u0026ldquo;What Middletown does to get its living\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The houses in which Middletown lives,\u0026rdquo; this pioneering project attempted an objective analysis of life in a small Midwestern American city (Muncie, Indiana). The Lynds\u0026rsquo; study was hailed as a very accessible report that was most appealing because it made \u0026ldquo;no attempt to prove anything\u0026rdquo; but simply recorded \u0026ldquo;what was observed.\u0026rdquo; The Lynds introduced their topic by saying their goal \u0026ldquo;was to study synchronously the interwoven trends that are the life of a small American city. A typical city, strictly speaking, does not exist, but the city studied was selected a shaving many features in common to a wide group of communities.\u0026rdquo; (Citation: Lynd 1929, 3Lynd, Robert S., and Helen Merrell Lynd.

The result was a \u0026ldquo;shooting script\u0026rdquo; for \u0026ldquo;things which should be photographed as American Background,\u0026rdquo; issued by Stryker to his team of photographers. The script contains an extensive listing of items like \u0026ldquo;People on and off the job,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do people look?,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The wall decoration in homes as an index to the different income groups and their reactions,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;A photographic study of use of leisure time in various income groups.\u0026rdquo;5\n Walker Evans.

The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles     Once Evans was officially on staff, his first trip under Stryker\u0026rsquo;s direction seems to have been an extended fall visit to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where steel mills, workers\u0026rsquo; housing, parading legionnaires, and elaborate gravestones (fig. 1, 2, 3) were his subjects. Between November 1935 and April 1936, Evans made two lengthy road trips that would account for the bulk of his entire production for the RA and many of the 169 mid-thirties pictures that follow this essay. From November to mid-January, here turned to industrial centers in Pennsylvania, finally spending some time in Pittsburgh, and went on to Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, following to some extent the course outlined in the memorandum above. In February 1936, he left again, with a completely Southern itinerary that would take him through many small cities, some of them renowned for ante-bellum architecture and Civil War battles, in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas, and Virginia.\nIn the spring of 1936, Stryker approved a furlough for Evans to work on a Fortune story with James Agee. This leave for mid-July through mid-September allowed Evans to return to the \u0026ldquo;middle south\u0026rdquo; with Agee to prepare \u0026ldquo;an article on cotton tenantry in the United States, in the form of a photographic and verbal record of the daily lives and environment of an average white family of tenant farmers\u0026rdquo; (fig. 4, 5, 6, 7). (Citation: Agee 1941, viiiAgee, James, and Walker Evans. Let Us Now Praise Famous Men: Three Tenant Families. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1941.) According to the terms of Stryker\u0026rsquo;s arrangement with Fortune\u0026rsquo;s art editor, the pictures Evans produced on this job would become the property of the RA after the magazine had run the finished essay in a fall issue.\n Walker Evans.

Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles      Once Evans returned from this trip south, during which he and Agee documented the lives of the Burroughs, Fields, and Tengle families in Alabama (see Bud Fields with His Wife and Burrough\u0026rsquo;s Family), he spent September and October printing his pictures and preparing presentations for both Fortune and Stryker.6 Stryker again talked about a New England trip, on which he planned to accompany the photographer, but it did not materialize, and Evans was once more sent to the South, this time to photograph the catastrophe of flooding in Arkansas and Tennessee. An unusual and demanding assignment for Evans, this trip of late January and February 1937 was made with another RA photographer, Edwin Locke, and required that he spend considerable time in the affected area, photographing the flood victims and their temporary shelters.\nThis would be his last travel for the RA, an agency that was absorbed into the Farm Security Administration at about this time. Evans\u0026rsquo;s contributions to the RA\u0026rsquo;s documentation of Depression-era America had essentially been obtained between the summer of 1935 and the spring of 1936, a period of less than a year. The Alabama pictures made while on leave to Fortune would become his best-known photographs and, ironically, those most closely identified with his work as a New Deal photographer.\nThe events generated by the Museum of Modern Art in the fall of 1938 could be viewed as the culmination of a highly productive period made possible by the patronage of the federal government. The sequences of images that appeared in the exhibition and book of American Photo-graphs, though composed of different selections and gleaned from a decade of the photographer\u0026rsquo;s work, might just as appropriately have appeared under the title of \u0026ldquo;Middletown.\u0026rdquo; In fact, Kirstein refers to the Lynds\u0026rsquo; Middletown in his American Photographs essay, suggesting that, although Evans\u0026rsquo;s work should not be considered merely \u0026ldquo;illustrative accompaniment,\u0026rdquo; a study such as theirs \u0026ldquo;might have been more effective had it also been plotted in visual terms.\u0026rdquo; (Citation: Kirstein 1938, 196Kirstein, Lincoln. Photographs of America: Walker Evans American Photographs. New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1938) An article by Anthony Westen titled \u0026ldquo;Middletown and Main Street,\u0026rdquo; one of the most insightful contemporary comments on Evans\u0026rsquo;s subject matter, appeared in Architectural Review to mark the publication of American Photographs. (Citation: West 1939, 218-20West, Anthony. Middletown and Main street. Architectual Review 85. 1939.)\nA closer look at two little-known RA images—one that appeared in both exhibition formats and one that appeared only in the book—provides a glimpse of how much the exhibitions and publication differed and of the way in which Evans went about editing his own work. Appearing almost in the very middle of the New York installation of American Photographs were two 1937 images of Arkansas flood refugees. One of them—a young African American woman asleep under a quilt in a heavy, metal-frame bed—is found in an almost square Getty print bearing an incomplete MoMA loan number. A second image of almost the same size—a person who looks more like an African American man, partially con-sealed behind a boldly patterned makeshift curtain—is also found at the Getty, but this print, apparently of the same vintage, does not possess a loan number or label. Both images have been severely cropped from the original negative.7 Prints of the two images hung as pendants in the New York show between a photograph of a poor Cuban family from 1933 and a picture of the Tengle family in Hale County, Alabama, singing hymns. The installation list for the circulating version of American Photographs calls for these two images to appear together, only this time toward the end of the show, in group XV (of eighteen groupings specified), where they would be part of a larger selection of seven pictures, including three Alabama tenant farmer images, two Cuban pictures of workingmen and women, and views of factories in Louisiana and wooden stores in Mississippi.\n Walker Evans. Arkansas Flood Refugee, 1937.   fullscreen  Figure 8    Walker Evans. Arkansas Flood Refugee, 1937. The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles     For the book, however, Evans chose a vertically oriented print from another negative of the sleeping woman mentioned above. This image (fig. 8), which might seem more invasive than intimate, is even more startling and unorthodox than the first. It presents the weary flood victim at bedside level, awake but nestled under the quilt. Below her on the floor of the old cotton warehouse that is supplying emergency shelter are a few items of clothing and a bedpan. Occurring at almost the exact center of the book—that is, as plate forty-four in a sequence of eighty-seven images—it falls between a van Gogh-like interior entitled Hudson Street Boarding House Detail, New York and a portrait of three working-class neighbors passing the time together in People in Summer, New York State Town. As comparative material from this winter of 1937 Arkansas assignment, three other prints in the Getty collection depict African American women displaced by the flood and huddled in or near a bed due to cold and illness. Like the two images chosen for the MoMA show, these three reflect substantial cropping of the negatives in an effort to close in on a single figure and eliminate the barn like interior of this uncomfortable temporary home.8 Always after portraits of \u0026ldquo;the anonymous people\u0026rdquo; of Middletown, Evans seems to have taken full advantage of the unusual vulnerability of these residents of Forrest City, Arkansas.\nEvans had company on this RA assignment, which must have been one of the hardest emotionally as well as technically of his career. The report submitted to Stryker by his more communicative colleague, Edwin Locke, gives an immediate picture of the conditions the two men found and the way they attempted to record them. It also con-firms Evans\u0026rsquo;s perfectionist nature, his persistent determination to get the right picture, and the reasons why Roy Stryker, like Tom Mabry, valued his work so highly. The handwritten letter on hotel stationery reads in part:\n My God, we are tired tonight! Got up at 6 this morning, worked until 5:30 PM, made the 6:20 PM train back to Memphis, having covered the refugee camps as well as we could without flashes. And now a word about the camps: L White camp (about 2 miles away from Negro camp—we covered this twice on foot with equipment): well run, adequate tent space, good (regular army) food. A detachment of soldiers from Fort Leavenworth are running the outfit along with the CCC\u0026hellip;. The Negro camp: Overcrowded. There are many more negroes than whites affected by flood in this area. Found 11 in one tent. They are not \u0026ldquo;happy-go-lucky\u0026rdquo; about it, but dazed, apathetic, and hopeless. There is a good deal of illness: excruciating coughs, pneumonia and influenza cases laying in a dark cotton warehouse. I shot in there with the Leica, but Walker said it was too dark. He bought photoflashes and shot with the 4x5, but is afraid that the exposures were wrong. He will undoubtedly want to go back\u0026hellip;.9\n Evans and Stryker parted ways, mostly because of the bureaucratic requirements that Stryker adhered to. Working under difficult conditions was certainly not some-thing the photographer shied away from, particularly when he was after the archetypal portrait of \u0026ldquo;Everyman\u0026rdquo; that he treasured. In pursuit of this goal, for his next major series Evans would contrive to photograph only by remote shutter release while riding the New York subway in winter.\nNotes   Memorandum draft by Walker Evans, reproduced in Walker Evans at Work, (New York: Harper and Row, 1982), 112. ↩ Walker Evans to Ernestine Evans, unfinished two-page letter in black ink on hotel stationery, dated Feb. 1934, first published in Walker Evans at Work, 98.

Posters and other publicity of later activists fighting racial, economic, and political oppression have borrowed from Lange’s icon of the time. The handsome, androgynous face, the pose of stoic anxiety, and the encumbrance of three young children proved to be universal attributes. With Lange’s artistry, Owens took on the timeless quality of Eugéne Delacroix’s strong female rebel (Liberty Leading the People), Jean-François Millet’s peasant woman (the agrarian ideal), Honoré Daumier’s laundresses (the working woman) and Käthe Kollwitz’s proletarian woman warrior (one of the mothers leading her Peasants’ War).\nOwens, although she became famous, did not enjoy, even momentarily, the life of a celebrity. She had three more children and kept moving with her family, following the California crops. She did become involved in efforts to organize farm labor and would sometimes serve as the straw boss, one who negotiates wages for migrants as the picking season begins. She was still working in the fields at age fifty before finally marrying again (to George Thompson) and settling into a stable life in Modesto, California.\nExhibitions Tradition and Innovation: Recent Additions to the Photographs Collection, the J.

George Burroughs, standing at the center, does not smile; rather, he looks proud and strong, his arms extended across the shoulders of his wife and eldest daughter on either side of him. The photograph shows the Burroughses as they wished to be seen and differs from other photographs of them that express Evans\u0026rsquo;s view, portraying their situation more bleakly.\nExhibitions Walker Evans: An Alabama Record, the J.
