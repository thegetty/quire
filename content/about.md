This is a starter theme for [Quire](https://gettypubs.github.io/quire/), a multiformat digital publishing framework. Quire can be used to generate a web book, EPUB and MOBI e-books, and a PDF optimized for print; all from a single set of text files. 

This starter theme allows for the quick customization of a few key styles to make you publication project your own.

- Modern and Classic type styles
- Cover and splash page images
- Accent color
- Background colors
- Navigation bar style
