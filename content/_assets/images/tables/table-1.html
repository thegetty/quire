    <strong>Duration of different steps in making a bronze sculpture</strong><br />
    <span class="details">The time required for each step depends on many parameters, including the size of the sculpture, its desired finish quality, the casting process employed, the number of parts requiring assembly, the amount of repair and fettling necessary, the type of patina used, and more. Time also depends on the available technologies and the production environment (e.g., a specific commission in a small workshop versus industrial production of a replica in an industrial foundry). Some extreme examples are given here based on historical documents and direct knowledge of recent fabrications.</span>
